description: Elasticbeat is a fantastic open source project part of the Elastic family. Beats are lightweight data shippers to 
capture all sorts of data such as logs, metrics or http responses. While utilizing these Beats I encountered various bugs inside of their
code. Working with the Elastic team I pushed out PRs to fix multiple bugs and submited multiple backport PRs. Example of such PRs <a href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/5568">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/5155">here</a>.
