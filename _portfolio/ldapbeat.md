description: Beats are lightweight data shippers to capture all sorts of data such as logs, metrics or http responses. A data repository I noticed was missing a beat was Active Directory/Directory services in general. As a result I created LDAPbeat, this beat lets you periodically query AD/any service that uses LDAP. This is super useful if you are measuring user activity or monitoring for any suspicious activity. [Github link](https://github.com/kwojcicki/ldapbeat)
