A couple of months back I relocated to the US after accepting a job offer from Microsoft. After clearing quarantine I visited my nearest bank branch and attempted to open up a bank account. To my surprise I learnt that I needed prove my current US address information and my lease agreement was not enough. I was told to obtain some sort of utility or rent bill. Not expecting that to be a challenge I said sure I will be back tomorrow with a bill in hand! Little did I know how wrong I was. 

After getting bank from the bank I attempted to pay my rent. I logged onto the apartment complex's payment site, submitted my credit card information and found out that the site does not accept Canadian billing addresses. I tried to change the billing information of my current credit card, but found out that my bank wouldn't let me us a US address. I found myself in a bit of a chicken and egg situation.

I decided that I would look into what utility bills I could pay for that the bank would accept. My apartment had a modem in the closet with a link to quick start my internet access. The link sent me to a seemingly apartment specific portal where, actually quite quickly, I was able to pay for an internet package and stop using my phones data. As part of the process I provided an email so I expected to receive some sort of bill relatively quickly. After waiting for 10 or so minutes without such an email I contacted the internet providers customer support asking them about a bill. The individual on the other end of the line informed me that they did not have access to those apartment portals and they could not assist me in receiving a bill for my services. 

Okay well internet and rent bills are off the table, what else is there? Electricity and water bills came next to my mind. As part of my welcome package I received a bundle of papers, one of these papers mentioned you would receive a key by email from the utility company that provides electricity to the building. This key would allow you to setup an account in their system and then pay your utility bills. I had not yet received an email from them so I went to the front desk and inquired when one would be sent. I was told that the utility company tends to take 2/3 weeks to send those keys out once your new lease has entered their database, but I should call them and perhaps I could get this key earlier. So I called them up and was told that I was not yet in their system and that I should call back the coming Monday. Which I did and was pleasantly surprised when the customer support agent verified I was in their database and a customer. I asked about receiving a bill earlier but was told that cannot be done, but instead they could send some sort of letter which should suffice to prove my current address. The letter was expected to arrive in 2 weeks which was fine but I was hoping to open my bank account sooner rather than later. 

The apartment complex which I'm living in has multiple internet service providers, so I decided to sign up with another internet provider and receive a bill from them. I called one of them up, insured that I would receive an electronic bill in 1/2 days and could merrily go on my way to open my bank account. I set up the cheapest plan they could find and waited for a confirmation email to setup my account with them. I waited over an hour and still didn't receive any account confirmation email. I called the company up again, and asked what the hold up was. Turns out they miswrote my email and replaced an 'n' with an 'm', reasonable mistake. They updated the email on their end and I quickly received the account confirmation email minutes later, paid my bill and thankfully the next day received my bill! Huzzah! Finally. 

When I went back to the bank with my bill in hand everything went smoothly and I was finally able to open my account. All in all from my first attempt at opening the account to finally opening the account it was a little over a week.

Overall this was just a small annoyance in an otherwise very smooth relocation and onboarding.
