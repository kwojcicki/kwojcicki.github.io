## How this blog was created

## What? Why? Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static website generator thats designed for building minimal, static blogs. Whats special about Jekyll is that Github Pages supports it. Meaning that you won't have to setup a local workstation and build the site locally. You can directly push the jekyll project and github will automatically build and serve the generated static website. Even though I prefer to use local build for testing out changes before pushing, still it makes things easier as I don't have to maintain separate branches for source and generated website.
Jekyll (and other static site generators) have a considerable advantage over other blogging platforms like wordpress. Its minimal. No database, no backend. You design your blog instead of struggling with complicated backend issues. And the best part is you outsource hosting to github.
