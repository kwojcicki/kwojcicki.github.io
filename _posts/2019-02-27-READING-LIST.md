# April 2022
- [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/381355.The_Bogleheads_Guide_to_Investing)

# March 2022
- [Winning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/866222.Winning). Not one of my favorite books, it seems more catered to those attempting to get into middle management or those with MBA's. While parts of the book are catered to a more general audience such as getting promoted, finding the right job and dealing with bad bosses, the rest of the novel is oriented around managerial tasks. Unfortunately, for those interested in entrepreneurship, many of the lessons provided in this book seem more oriented to managers within larger firms, and less for those managers in new growing business.
- [Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes). I quite enjoyed this book. In this piece the authors expressed a framework they call [Principled Negotiation](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/principled-negotiation-focus-interests-create-value/) that is meant to replace the typical negotiation style of [Positional Bargaining](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/positional-bargaining/#:~:text=Positional%20bargaining%20is%20an%20approach,low%20(or%20high)%20one.) (i.e. how most car, house purchases are performed). The authors are very realistic about their approach and do not attempt to portrait it as an end all to all your negotiation issues. Unlike many other self-help books I found this one was quite good about not repeating itself, instead each chapter was an entirely new section. The novel is segregated into two main sections, one where the framework is described and then another where common questions are answered. The former moves at a brisk pace and is chalk full of valuable advice that one can immediately start using in their daily lives. The FAQ provided in the latter half is an excellent addition, removing many initial confusions and concerns. Definitely a valuable read. 
- [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629.Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance). The enjoyment Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance brings to its readers is definitely hit or miss, personally I found it more of a miss. It reminded me of my highschool English classes where we were asked to read between the lines of what Shakespeare or Homer had written. The copy of the book I purchased had a prelude in which it gave away a plot twist which greatly reduced the enjoyment I received from the novel. The actual writing and face value of the writing I enjoyed greatly, but I definitely was not able to appreciate the deeper message behind this novel. This is not a novel you can rush through when reading, you need to read and reread every sentence and be in the correct state of mind.
