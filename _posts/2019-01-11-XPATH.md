# Intro

With the craze of microservices having a continuous integration pipeline with your favorite

A big part of having a CI pipeline in place is automated tests, which includes regression tests for your UI component.  

# TLDR

Add unique identifiers to the elements you wish to interact with inside of your tests either using the html attribute "id" or your own attribute/combination of attributes. Then have very simple locators of 

```
//*[@id=the_unique_identifier]

or

//*[@attribute1=part_of_unique_identifier and @attribute2=other_part_of_unique_identifier]
```

# XPath

So what exactly is XPath? Well as defined the [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/all/) website itself, "XPath is a language for addressing parts of an XML document, designed to be used by both XSLT and XPointer."

# Examples

## Intro

Many XPath expressions resemble that of traversing your favorite Unix filesystem ie ```cd /``` navigates you to  the root direction ```/``` as a XPath expression returns the root element.

Lets start off with this simple html block
```
<body>
	<div>
		<span>
			<p>
				<strong>
					XPath is awesome!
				</strong>
			</p>
		</span>
	</div>
</body>
```
Here the expression ```/``` would return the entire html block while ```/body/div/span/p``` would return ```<p><strong>XPath is awesome!</strong></p>```.

Similarly ```/body/div/span/p/strong``` would return ```<strong>XPath is awesome!</strong>```. 

Writing the entire path to an element can get tedious for that we can use ```//``` vs ```/```. The difference between the two is ```/``` is for absolute paths while ```//``` is for relative paths. For example ```/body/strong``` will only match with elements which are strong are and the direct child of a body tag, in this case it will match with nothing. However ```/body//strong``` will return ```<strong>XPath is awesome!</strong>```.
