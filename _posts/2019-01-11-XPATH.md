# Intro

With the craze of microservices having a continuous integration pipeline with your favorite

A big part of having a CI pipeline in place is automated tests, which includes regression tests for your UI component.  

# TLDR

Add unique identifiers to the elements you wish to interact with inside of your tests either using the html attribute "id" or your own attribute/combination of attributes. Then have very simple locators of 

```
//*[@id=the_unique_identifier]

or

//*[@attribute1=part_of_unique_identifier and @attribute2=other_part_of_unique_identifier]
```

# XPath

So what exactly is XPath? Well as defined the [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/all/) website itself, "XPath is a language for addressing parts of an XML document, designed to be used by both XSLT and XPointer."

# Examples

## Intro

Many XPath expressions resemble that of traversing your favorite Unix filesystem ie ```cd /``` navigates you to  the root direction ```/``` as a XPath expression returns the root element.

Lets start off with this simple html block:
```
<body>
	<div>
		<span>
			<p>
				<strong>
					XPath is awesome!
				</strong>
			</p>
		</span>
	</div>
</body>
```
Here the expression ```/``` would return the entire html block while ```/body/div/span/p``` would return ```<p><strong>XPath is awesome!</strong></p>```.

Similarly ```/body/div/span/p/strong``` would return ```<strong>XPath is awesome!</strong>```. 

Writing the entire path to an element can get tedious for that we can use ```//``` vs ```/```. The difference between the two is ```/``` is for absolute paths while ```//``` is for relative paths. For example ```/body/strong``` will only match with elements which are strong and the direct child of a body tag, in this case it will match with nothing. However ```/body//strong``` will return ```<strong>XPath is awesome!</strong>```.

You may have noticed all the expressions so far have started off with ```/body``` as you can probably figure out this means we are looking for a body top level element, and could use ```//body```. 

## Attributes

This time will use the following html block:
```
<body>
	<div id='Article'>
		<div id='Title' class='Bold Highlighted Box'> 
			Lorem Ipsum
		</div>
		<div id='Content'>
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis et interdum ipsum.
		</div>
		<div id='Footer'>
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis et interdum ipsum.
		</div>
	</div>
</body>
```

Lets get the div with an id of ```Title``` for that the following expression will work ```//div[@id='Title']``` pretty simple right? Also goes to show you how useful giving elements a unique tag will be for testing.

XPath selectors work for all types of attributes ```//div[@class='Bold Highlighted Box']``` will also return the title div. 

Now what if we dont know the full value of the attribute, here we can use ```starts-with``` and ```ends-with```. For example lets say we want to select all elements that have a class ending with ```Box``` we could use the following selector ```//div[ends-with(@class, 'Box')]```.

Unfortunately XPath does not have a great way of checking if part of a space separated list equals to something else so the following hack could be used ```//div[contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' expected-class ')]```. This is very useful for doing a class check.

## Operators

So far all our queries have been using the standard ```=``` operator but as in most programming languages XPath has access to many other operators such as ```!=, >, >=, <=, and, or, not```. 

For example 
```
<body>
	<div role='row'>
		<div role='product' class='unselected' price='25'> 
			Toothbrush
		</div>
		<div role='product' class='unselected' price='25'> 
			Haircomb
		</div>
		<div role='product' class='unselected' price='10'>
			Flour
		</div>
		<div role='promotion' class='unselected' price='25'>
			Rice
		</div>
	</div>
</body>
```

Now lets get all the divs that are products, are unselected by the user and cost more than 20$, ```//div[@role='product' and @class='unselected' and @price > 20]```. This will return both the toothbrush div and the haircomb div.
