# Introduction

Traefik is a [cloud native reverse proxy](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/), meaning it's both a bodyguard and a guide to your backend. It intercepts incoming requests and routes them to the intended services according to rules set by you, potentially even modifying the requests. There are a multitude of benefits from using a reverse proxy:

- **Load Balancing**: Traefik can distribute incoming traffic to maximize speed and utilization of your services
- **Request Acceleration**: Traefik can compress incoming and outgoing data; in the future, Traefik may also support [caching](https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/878)
- **Security**: Traefik protects your backend service's identity and acts as another layer of defence by acting as the gateway

# Core definitions

Traefik revolves around three key concepts:

- [**Entrypoints**](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/entrypoints/) are essentially synonyms for a port and protocol tuple (i.e. `5000/udp`), with `[host]:port[/tcp|/udp]` being its exact definition
- [**Services**](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/services/) forward the incoming request to your actual services
- [**Routers**](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/) serve as an intermediary between Entrypoints and Services. Routers have user defined rules that decide which Traefik service the incoming request should go to

Let's return to our bodyguard and guide metaphor. Entrypoints are the heavily forfeited doors to our backend. Once a request has gone through the door it is handled by our bodyguards (Routers) which ensure the request should be here and find out where it wishes to go. The bodyguards then escort the request to our guides (Services) which handle delivery to our backend service.

Here's a high level architecture diagram of Traefik:

[![Traefik architecture ](https://docs.traefik.io/assets/img/architecture-overview.png)](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/overview/)

An incoming request talks to an Entrypoint. Routers corresponding to that Entrypoint examine the request (Host, Path, Headers, Method) to determine which Service this request should be handed off to. The Service that receives the request is responsible for forwarding the request to its end destination.

Having these key components divided and independent of one another allows Traefik to be customized to every use case.

# Simple Example

Let's take a look at a simple example to better understand Traefik's key concepts. Let's imagine we have a simple service called `whoami` that we are looking to expose to the outer world. `whoami` simply returns information about the machine it is deployed on.

For this tutorial we will be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). We'll create a `docker-compose.yml` file defining our Traefik and `whoami` service.

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  reverse-proxy:
    # The official v2 Traefik docker image
    image: traefik:v2.3
    ports:
      # The HTTP port
      - "80:80"
      # The Web UI (enabled by api.insecure=true)
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      # So that Traefik can listen to the Docker events
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      # So that we can configure Traefik
      - "./config.toml:/etc/traefik/traefik.toml"
  whoami:
    # A container that exposes an API to show its host IP address
    image: containous/whoami
```

Next, create a file in the same location as the `docker-compose.yml` called `config.toml`

```toml
[global]
  checkNewVersion = false
  sendAnonymousUsage = false

[log]
  level = "DEBUG"

[entryPoints] # Creating an entrypoint listening on port 80 with the default protocol of TCP
  [entryPoints.server]
    address = ":80"

[http.routers] # Creating a router which routes all requests matching Host == whoami.docker.localhost to the whoami-service
  [http.routers.my-router]
    rule = "Host(`whoami.docker.localhost`)"
    service = "whoami-service"

[http.services]  # Defining a service called whoami-service with its accompanying url
  [http.services.whoami-service.loadBalancer]
    [[http.services.whoami-service.loadBalancer.servers]]
      url = "http://whoami:80"

[api]
  insecure = true # Enables the web UI

[providers] # Providers will be looked at in the next section
  [providers.file]
    filename = "/etc/traefik/traefik.toml"
```

Start the containers using `docker-compose up`. Then in another terminal let's curl our `whoami` service.

`curl -H Host:whoami.docker.localhost http://127.0.0.1` returning

```
Hostname: 10a2a065a5a7
IP: 127.0.0.1
...
```

So what we've done is defined a TCP entrypoint on port 80. We've also created a http router that will examine the incoming request coming in on port 80 (specifically the Host header) and any requests with a Host header of `whoami.docker.localhost` will be routed to the `whoami-service` service. Next, we define our http service `whoami-service` which simply defines the URL of our docker container.

![Basic Traefik example](/img/posts/traefik_basic.png)

All relatively simple and straightforward, albeit not particularly useful.

# Providers: A deeper look into Traefik

Traefik's configuration has two separate forms: static and dynamic. The static portion can be configured as part of a file, CLI arguments, or environment variables. The dynamic section can be fed to Traefik in a multitude of formats. The most time consuming is in the file alongside the static portion, but it's also possible to use your favorite orchestrator (Docker, Kubernetes, Consul Catalog, ...) or key value store (Redis, Zookeeper, etcd) to feed Traefik its dynamic configuration. **Entrypoints** and **Providers** are defined in the static portion, while **Routers** and **Services** are defined in the dynamic portion. **Providers** are existing infrastructure components (Docker, Kubernetes, Redis, Zookeeper, ...) which can be queried by Traefik to automatically discover new **Routers** and **Services**.

Providers give Traefik lots of flexibility as Routers and Services can be defined after Traefik has already started which can be useful as your services go offline or get put on new machines.

We'll be using the Docker provider for the rest of the tutorial.

# Real Use Case

Now, let's imagine a more realistic use case for Traefik where we have several microservices our clients wish to fetch data from. Our system represents a simplistic shopping website with services called `order` (with a URI of `/order`), `account` (with a URI of `/api/v1/account`) and `inventory` (with a URI of `/api/v1/inventory`). All services performing actions related to their names; We'll also have an `auth` service.

```yaml
# handles all requests related to orders. Requires authentication
order:
  image: containous/whoami

# handles all requests related to inventory
inventory:
  image: containous/whoami

# handles all requests related to accounts. Requires authentication
account:
  image: containous/whoami

# our auth service which all calls to account/order must go through
auth:
  image: lthummus/auththingie
```

Since any user is free to browse our `inventory`, those routes can be accessed without authorization. But, for our all `order` and `account` requests the user must be authenticated. We can accomplish this using Traefik's middleware pattern.

> [Middlewares](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/) attach to a router and enable us to modify the request using Traefik's pre-created [middlewares](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/#available-middlewares).

The [ForwardAuth](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/forwardauth/) middleware delegates user authentication to an external service (for us we will delegate to our `auth` service).

```yaml
reverse-proxy:
  image: traefik:v2.3
  ...
  labels:
    - "traefik.enable=true"
    # defining a ForwardAuth middleware called test-auth, which forwards all authentication to the auth service
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.test-auth.forwardauth.address=http://reverse-proxy/auth"
```

Defining all middlewares under `reverse-proxy` is not necessary, and similar to variable definition the middlewares definition should correspond to its usage.

Now, let's have the `order` service utilize our `test-auth` middleware

```yaml
# handles all requests related to orders. Requires authentication
order:
  image: containous/whoami
  labels:
    - "traefik.enable=true"
    - "traefik.http.routers.order.entrypoints=server"
    - "traefik.http.routers.order.middlewares=test-auth" # specifying what middlewares to use
    - "traefik.http.routers.order.rule=Path(`/order`)"
```

Putting that all together we have a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  reverse-proxy:
    image: traefik:v2.3
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - "./config.toml:/etc/traefik/traefik.toml"
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.test-auth.forwardauth.address=http://reverse-proxy/auth"

  # handles all requests related to orders. Requires authentication
  order:
    image: containous/whoami
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.order.entrypoints=server"
      - "traefik.http.routers.order.middlewares=test-auth"
      - "traefik.http.routers.order.rule=Path(`/order`)" # the order service handles all requests with a path of /order

  # handles all requests related to inventory
  inventory:
    image: containous/whoami
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.inventory.entrypoints=server"
      - "traefik.http.routers.inventory.rule=Path(`/api/v1/inventory`)" # the inventory service handles all requests with a path of /api/v1/inventory

  # handles all requests related to accounts. Requires authentication
  account:
    image: containous/whoami
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.account.entrypoints=server"
      - "traefik.http.routers.account.middlewares=test-auth"
      - "traefik.http.routers.account.rule=Path(`/api/v1/account`)" # the account service handles all requests with a path of /api/v1/account

  # our auth service which all calls to account/order must go through
  auth:
    image: lthummus/auththingie
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    volumes:
      - ./authconfig.conf:/authconfig.conf
    environment:
      - AUTHTHINGIE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/authconfig.conf
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth.entrypoints=server"
      - "traefik.http.routers.auth.rule=Path(`/auth`)"
```

And a new updated `config.toml` file:

```toml
[global]
  checkNewVersion = false
  sendAnonymousUsage = false

[log]
  level = "DEBUG"

[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.server]
    address = ":80"

    [entryPoints.server.forwardedHeaders]
      insecure = true # necessary for the auth service we are using. Not to be used in production

[api]
  insecure = true # Enables the web UI

[providers.docker]
  exposedByDefault = false
```

As well as a `authconfig.conf` for configuring our [`auth`](https://github.com/LtHummus/AuthThingie/) service.

```apacheconf
auththingie {
  domain: reverse-proxy
  secretKey: "test"
  rules: [
    {
      "name": "/*",
      "pathPattern": "/*",
      "hostPattern": "reverse-proxy",
      "public": true,
      "permittedRoles": []
    }
  ]

  users: [
    {
      "htpasswdLine": "test:$2y$05$WgJrjE0ao3gbysOcE1F6.utXniEudCDEQ5EABjkBOVHze5iM/rFu2",
      "admin": true,
      "roles": [],
    }
  ]

  authSiteUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:9000"
}
```

Now, let's restart our solution with `Ctrl + C` and `docker-compose up`.

Next, let's get some orders with `curl http://127.0.0.1/order` which will return an empty respond. Why? Because we are not authenticated and Traefik did not forward our request to the backend. Let's now authenticate by passing an `Authorization` header (corresponding to the `htpasswdLine` we set in the `authconfig.conf` but that's not too important).

`curl http://127.0.0.1/order -H "Authorization: Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0"`

```
Hostname: a9b412305755
IP: 127.0.0.1
...
```

Our auth service verifies the `Authorization` token we sent it (you can verify the authentication process by sending a different `Authorization` token and seeing the request fail) then proceeds to forward the request to the actual `order` service.

We can test out our `account` service in a similar fashion

```
~/workspace# curl http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/account -H "Authorization: Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0"
Hostname: 8c8415d0c974
IP: 127.0.0.1
...

~/workspace# curl http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/account -H "Authorization: Basic dGVzdDp0ZXM=" -v
...
>
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
```

But we can access our inventory without any need for authentication.

```
~/workspace# curl http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/inventory
Hostname: 570d161310c2
IP: 127.0.0.1
...
```

![Real Use Case Traefik](/img/posts/real_usecase.png)

# Advanced Middleware Usage

You may have noticed in the previous example the `order` service responded to `/order` requests. While `account` and `inventory` had a prefix of `/api/v1/` in their paths. Let's pretend that the team reworked the `order` service to have two APIs: the old one is available at `/api/v1/order`, and a new one is available at `/api/v2/order`. We would like to remedy this situation without having to discontinue any clients that continue to use the `/order` endpoint.

We'll utilize the [Chain](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/chain/) and [AddPrefix](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/addprefix/) middlewares to accomplish this.

```yaml
# handles all requests related to orders. Requires authentication
order:
  image: containous/whoami
  labels:
    - "traefik.enable=true"
    - "traefik.http.routers.order_deprecated.entrypoints=server"
      # our order service has gone through a complete rehaul, resulting in an /api/v1/order and /api/v2/order. However originally all clients simply used /order so we can add /api/v1 path prefix to any request that requests /order.
    - "traefik.http.routers.order_deprecated.middlewares=deprecated-clients"
    - "traefik.http.routers.order_deprecated.rule=Path(`/order`)"
    - "traefik.http.routers.order.entrypoints=server"
    - "traefik.http.routers.order.middlewares=test-auth"
    - "traefik.http.routers.order.rule=Path(`/api/v2/order`) || Path(`/api/v1/order`)"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.deprecated-clients.chain.middlewares=add-version,test-auth"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.add-version.addprefix.prefix=/api/v1"
```

We'll utilize the same `authconfig.conf` and `config.toml` as before.

![Advanced Use Case Traefik](/img/posts/advanced_traefik.png)

# UDP

Let's also expand our services to include a `track` service which sends minute by minute GPS data of ones purchase. Since this is minutely data it's okay if a packet gets lost here and there, so we'll use UDP for this service.

```yaml
# handles sending minutely data about a purchase
track:
  image: containous/whoamiudp
  labels:
    - "traefik.enable=true"
    - "traefik.udp.routers.track.entrypoints=server-udp"
```

We'll also have to create a new entrypoint that listens for UDP.

```toml
[entryPoints]
  ...
  [entryPoints.server-udp]
  address = ":81/udp"

```

And expose port 81 on Traefik's container

```yaml
reverse-proxy:
  image: traefik
  ports:
    - "80:80"
    - "81:81/udp"

First let's restart our solution with `Ctrl + C` and `docker-compose up`. Next, using `nc` ([Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat)) we can confirm the ability to connect to our new `track` service.

```
~/workspace# nc 127.0.0.1 81 -v -u
