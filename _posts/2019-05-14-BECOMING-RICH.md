As I am slightly larger than average, 6 feet ~200 pounds, I tend to eat more than people around me. This got me thinking, maybe if I just starve myself I could lose weight and make a few million dollars! 

According to this [calorie calculator](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) and myfitnesspal I need to eat around 2300 calories to maintain my weight with little to no exercise. With light exercise 1-3 times a week this gets bumped up to 2700 calories a day. Considering that I have been at my current weight for a while I likely am eating close to 2700 calories a day. 

A [survey](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-12-439) done in 2012 suggested that the average North American weights 178 pounds (I believe this stat is across both sexes). Using the same calculator + activity level the average North American eats about 2500 calories a day. So typically I eat 200 calories a day more than the average North American.

This begs the question what's the typical dollar value of a calorie?

If I just guzzle canola oil, I will need to eat/drink an extra ~25ml of oil.

Which at my local supermarket will cost me a whole 0.05825$ extra a day. Given I am approaching 22 years and assuming I keep up this consumption to my late 70s. I would spend an extra (0.05825$ * 365 * (70 - 22)) = 1020.54$. 

As one could expect a pure canola oil diet isn't likely to keep me alive for a long time... So lets take a look at prices for some premade meals.

I have seen some good looking [ham/cheese baguettes](https://www.independentcitymarket.ca/Food/Deli-%26-Ready-Meals/Ready-Meals-%26-Sides/Sandwiches-%26-Lunch-Kits/Ham-and-Compt%C3%A9-Cheese-Baguette/p/20786966_EA).

To round off the meal we can add a nice [garden salad](https://www.independentcitymarket.ca/Food/Meal-Kits-%26-Deli/Ready-Meals-%26-Sides/Salads/Garden-Salad-with-Cheese%2C-Small/p/20099003_KG).

If I add an extra 100 calories from the sandwich and the salad I would be spending an extra 4$  a day (1.25$ a day from the sandwich and 2.82$ from the salad). Which would be (4$ * 365 * (70 - 22)) = 71264$ by the time I am 70. Now this is not a million dollars but lets see what happens when we invest that money with a return of 10%.

And BOOM! over 1 million dollars in 48 years if I just start eating less now. 

But why should I stop at eating 2500 calories a day. If dropping 200 calories got me a million dollars why don't I drop 1000 calories and really start raking in the cash. Or I can just stop eating at all, just have vitamin gummy bears and water. Next self made billionaire here I come!
