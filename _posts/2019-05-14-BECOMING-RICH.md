Take anything I say in this article with a grain of salt.

As a slightly larger than average, 6 feet ~200 pounds, I tend to eat more than people around me. This got me thinking, maybe if I just starve myself I could lose weight and make a few million! 

According to this [calorie calculator](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) and myfitnesspal I need to eat around 2300 calories to maintain my weight with little to no excerise. With light excerise 1-3 times a week this gets bumped up to 2700 calories a day. Considering that I have been at my current weight for a while I likely am eating close to 2700 calories a day. 

A [survey](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-12-439) done in 2012 the average North american weights 178 pounds (I believe this stat is across both sexes). Using the same calculator + activity level the average north american eats about 2500 calories a day. So typically eat I eat 200 calories a day more than the average north american.

Now whats the typical dollar value of a calorie? All these prices/nutrition facts will be based on the [independent city market website](https://www.independentcitymarket.ca).

Now if I just guzzle some canola oil, I will need to eat/drink an extra ~25ml of oil.

Which at my local supermarket will cost me a whole 0.05825$ extra a day. Given I am approaching 22 years and assuming I keep up this consumption to my late 60s. I would spend an extra (0.05825$ * 365 * (60 - 22)) = $807. 

As one could expect a pure canola oil diet isn't likely to keep me alive for a long time... So lets take a look at prices for some ready meals.

I have seen some good looking ham/cheese baguettes at my supermarket, and to round off the meal we can add a nice garden salad.
