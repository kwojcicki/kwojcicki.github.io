# Introduction

> Disclaimer: I am neither a nutritionist nor an expert on anything related to nutrition. This is simply explaining what I did.

First I would like to give some context, in how I got to my peak weight of 110kgs (240 lbs). In highschool I played a lot of soccer and was a sizeable 6 foot tall teenager. This allowed to me eat all. Once I went to university I stopped playing as much soccer, as one would expect I gained a decent amount of weight due to that change. Additionally, when I begun interning at various companies, I gained the misconecption that if I was ever tired I simply needed to eat more food.

Eventually I grew tired of out growing my clothes and decided to make many changes in my life. Heres a list of things that I changed which helped me go from 110 kgs (240 pounds) to 80 kgs (175 pounds) in a little over a year.

- [Intermittent fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting) (IF) is a describes a few types of fasting, one of which is periodic fasting where an individual eats for 8 hours a day then fasts the other 16 hours of the day (I see many doing a more extreme 6/18 split). The idea behind restricting the time when you can eat is in a short period of time you can only stuff your self so much. Therefore you will naturally limit your caloric intact and lose weight. I tend to eat breakfast around 8 and try to have dinner around 6/7. This puts my range slightly higher than the 8/16 split but I found it helped me limit my calories, sleep (not going to sleep on a full stomach) and defecate more regularly
- [Calorie in, Calorie out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_calorie_is_a_calorie) (CICO) is an idea that a calorie, regardless from source, is in the end a calorie. In addition every human body needs a certain amount of calories to function ([Total Daily Energy Expenditure Calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/)). These were the main concepts I used when "constructing my diet", I got a rough estimate of how many calories I needed to eat to lose weight and then tried to eat that many calories. Granted I am [Celiac](https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/) ie I cannot eat wheat, meaning I naturally eat healthier as I can't eat most fast food. I tried to follow the plate division thought up by [Athlean-X, a youtuber/physical therapist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ0QXCTqjUs).
- Exercise, perhapes suprisingly for some, I did 0 cardio (aside from during warmups). Instead I focused on [weight lifting](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/frankoman-dumbbell-only-split.html).
